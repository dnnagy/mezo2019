Calculating current:\\ 
\begin{equation*}
    j = \Psi^* \textrm{grad} \Psi - h.c.
\end{equation*}
reflection and transmission coefficients. \\
Square scattering region with 3 leads (channels) <- calculate incoming and outgoing currents.\\
Separate channel from lead. They're not the same thing.\\
scattering matrix for this system.
\begin{equation*}
    |out\rangle = S|in\rangle
\end{equation*}

Main THing:
Hamiltionan -> Green function -> scattering matrix from green function -> Conductivity from S matrix.
